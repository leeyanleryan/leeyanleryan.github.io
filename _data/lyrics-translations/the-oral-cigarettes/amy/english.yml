  What are you doing right now?
  I'm definitely in love.
  I've never felt this way before.
  The one who truly understood me was...
  I realised it was you.

  Without realizing it,
  We've come a long way, haven't we?
  It was always for you.
  That's what I was thinking.

  The time I had given up on with you...
  I felt like I could reach it if I stretched out my hand a little.
  If I could turn back time...
  I want to say something to you.
  I'm sorry... thank you.

  Amy, the two of us, here and now...
  Those days we huddled close...
  When I remember them, my heart tightens deep inside.
  Amy, the two of us, here and now...
  The fact that we'll meet again...
  I'll keep waiting and believing.
  No matter what happens, always.
  Hey, you feel the same way... don't you?

  As the seasons passed...
  If you still really care about me...
  Even if it's too late now, I don't mind.
  I'll hold your little hand.

  My beloved,
  Is my voice reaching you?
  Gently, to protect the one I love.

  Amy, the two of us, here and now...
  Those days we huddled close...
  When I remember them, my heart tightens deep inside.
  So that people around the world can laugh...
  I'm sending this song.
  Hey, Amy... that's okay, right?
