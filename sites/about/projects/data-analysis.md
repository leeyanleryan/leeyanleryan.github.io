      The project aimed to classify breast cancer samples (benign vs. malignant) by analyzing imaging attributes from a fine needle aspirate (FNA). It also explored mislabelled
      data detection to improve data quality.
    </h5>
    <h5 class="h5-text-gap">
      This project was completed by me and three others for IT1244, a machine learning course at NUS. We chose this topic because we believed that discovering an effective 
      solution could significantly benefit the medical field.
    </h5>
    <h5 class="h5-img-gap">
      Dataset:
      <ul class="ul-margin-top-0">
        <li>569 samples labeled 'B' (benign) or 'M' (malignant)</li>
        <li>30 features capturing mean, standard error and "worst" measurements of cell nuclei (i.e., radius, texture, concavity)</li>
        <li>Correlation analysis identified the most influential features (i.e., radius, concavity, concave points)</li>
      </ul>

      The problem was split into two tasks. For the first task, we are told that some labels have been mislabelled, and we are required to detect them. We utilised several
      methods, combining them together to perform a multi-faceted approach in the detection process.
    </h5>
    <h5 class="h5-text-gap">
      The attribute 'radius' refers to the radius of the tumour. The bigger the tumour, the more harmful it is, falling into the malignant category. We performed feature
      engineering on this attribute, taking the squared difference and cubed difference of radius_worst and radius_mean. This allowed the data to split almost perfectly
      into two categories, one benign (blue), the other malignant (red). The blues above the curve and the reds below the curve are considered mislabelled data.

      Task 1 - Mislabelled Data Detection Methods:
      <ul class="ul-margin-top-0">
        <li>Feature Engineering: Computed differences (worst - mean) and examined squared/cubed values to distinguish benign vs. malignant curves</li>
        <li>K-Means Clustering: Ran multiple initializations to find consistent outliers</li>
        <li>Logistic Regression: Tested whether flagged points consistently mismatched the known labels</li>

      For the second task, we are required to classify the type of breast cancer ('B' vs 'M') given the diagnosis. To do this, we employed the use of several Machine
      Learning algorithms, using 10-fold cross-validation and multiple metrics like Accuracy, F1 Score and ROC-AUC to assess the model.

      The project aimed to enhance overall guest experience at Universal Studios Singapore (USS). This project was completed by me and 7 others for DSA3101, a course in NUS on
      practical Data Science.

      My objective is to optimally allocate staff to different attractions at an amusement park (e.g., Universal Studios Singapore) in order to reduce wait times and improve guest

      </ol>
    </h5>
    <h5>
      By comparing Linear Optimization and a Greedy Heuristic, this system provides two distinct allocations for staff assignment—one aligning more proportionally 
      with forecasted wait times, and another always feasible but potentially less proportional. Users can choose the final allocation that best fits their operational 
      goals and constraints.
