      I initially created my website as a way to display my portfolio. With a website, I have the freedom
      to elaborate more on the details of my resume, using gifs and images to make reading more engaging.
      It also provides a platform to host my resume 24/7, allowing employers to get the most up-to-date
      version of my resume easily.
    </h5>
    <h5 class="h5-text-gap">
      To make the website, I took a html template from w3schools, and used GitHub pages to host my site.
      Eventually, I integrated Jekyll, allowing me to make default templates and layouts to be used in
      any part of the site, increasing the scalability and consistency of development. The languages used
      to make the website are HTML, CSS, JS, and Liquid.

      After a while, I bought a domain from Squarespace as I wanted my website to have a domain that is
      easy to remember, and easy to say out loud. Configuring the DNS for the domain was a little tricky,
      but it worked out in the end, allowing me to host my website on <a href="/" target="_blank">https://www.leeyanleryan.com</a>.

      I frequently listen to music of varying languages. More often than not, it is difficult to find a
      website that includes original text, romanised text, and English translation. Thus, I have dedicated
      a portion of my website to translating song lyrics.
    </h5>
    <h5 class="h5-text-gap">
      A feature my website provides unlike other websites is an explanation box that can be viewed when
      clicking on any part of the lyrics. This explanation box breaks down each word, providing the romanised
      word and English meaning. This gives the reader some understanding on how I translated the sentence.
    </h5>
    <h5 class="h5-text-gap">
      Another unique feature I implemented is the "Test" section at the bottom of a song's lyrics. It pulls 
      random sentences from the song, highlights a specific word or phrase from it, and asks the user
      to determine the English meaning or function of the highlighted word. This helps users in further
      understanding the words used in the song.
    </h5>
    <h5>
      Because I have to break down the sentence and provide explanations, I occassionally find errors in 
      transcriptions provided from online sources. So, I believe my website is great in providing accurate 
      translations.
