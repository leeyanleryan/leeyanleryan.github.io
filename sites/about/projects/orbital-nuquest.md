        NUqueSt is a 2D Top-Down Action-Adventure Singleplayer Questing game. It was heavily inspired by Stardew Valley, incorporating core gameplay elements
      such as fighting, farming and mining. It features 3 different biomes, 8 Non-Playable-Characters (NPCs), 6 ores, 3 enemies, 1 boss and 40 quests.

      The main purpose of creating NUqueSt was to help familiarise incoming undergraduates with the challenges of various courses in a fun and interactive way.
      We achieved this by gamifying each course into a quest. For example, the computing course “CS1010” became an N-Queens puzzle, where players had to provide 
      two valid configurations for placing 6 queens on a 6x6 board. These quests are given by the NPCs, and reward the player with GPA upon completion.

        My friend
      <a href="https://github.com/thawtunzan" target="_blank">
        Thaw</a> and I developed NUqueSt for CP2106 (Orbital), a three-month software engineering course at NUS during AY22/23 Special Term. We followed 
        an agile methodology with monthly sprints. Each sprint began with planning feasible features and ended with peer reviews, alongside the creation of a 
        poster and video to showcase the project. We then incorporated feedback in subsequent sprints, guiding us toward the right direction.

      For our project, we were awarded Artemis (Extreme), the highest level of achievement, placing us roughly in the top 5% of the cohort. The link to the
