      Hi! Welcome to my website. My name is Ryan Lee, and I am currently an undergraduate at National University of Singapore (NUS), studying
      Data Science and Analytics. In the near future, I am hoping to undertake a Masters or PhD programme to dive deeper into my topics of interests.
      <br><br>
      I have a deep passion for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which I explore in my projects. For my 'Board Games' projects, I design the
      game logic for several board games such as Chess, allowing me to implement AI into enemy bots. For my 'Data Analysis' projects, I employ several 
      Machine Learning algorithms onto datasets for analysis and predictions.
      <br><br>
      My hobbies include reading, playing computer games, playing piano and walking. In the 'Hobbies' section, I showcase rankings I have achieved 
      across various competitive games.
      <br><br>
      If you would like to find out more about me, you can navigate to different sections by clicking on the arrows on the left or right, or use the
      menu button at the top-left of the page.
