      I taught 25 NUS undergraduates CS1010E, a course on programming methodology in Python. The course
      educates students from the ground up, allowing those with no programming background to acquire computational
      skills at a moderate pace while having fun.

      I incorporated animations and transitions learnt from my digital production assistant role into the PowerPoint
      slides. This allowed me to better visualise the flow of the code to bridge learning gaps. The animations also
      helped in keeping the students engaged in looking at the slides, as it would capture their attention.

    For their first lesson, I conducted the 'Spaghetti Tower' icebreaker challenge as a way to convey the analogy 
    that coding is an iterative process. The goal of the challenge was to make the tallest tower using spaghetti
    sticks and marshmallow. The students were split into 4 different groups, each building unique structures. The
    tallest tower was around 50cm.

    I received 9 nominations for teaching excellence, as well as better reviews on average compared to several
    departments, showing the efficiency of my teaching. The feedback report can be found
