      I collaborated with 3 professors and 2 other digital production assistants on producing engaging
      educational videos on Generative AI and Machine Learning. These videos are made for courses published
      under NUS Blended Learning 2.0, to be used by NUS professors and staff to gain relevant knowledge on 
      recent AI/ML advancements.
    </h5>
    <h5 class="h5-text-gap">
      The general workflow starts from understanding lecture slides made by the professors, converting them 
      into slides that are simple to understand, as well as integrating PowerPoint animations and transitions 
      to convey information better. Afterwards, we used Camtasia to mix the voice recordings and slides together,
      ensuring that volume levels stay consistent throughout the video. Lastly, we added captions using Descript,
      which are stored in .srt files so that the viewer can disable and enable captions whenever needed.
